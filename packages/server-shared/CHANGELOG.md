### Minor Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - The package becomes the one source of the server protocol. `toAgentRunResponse()` builds the answer of an agent run for every adapter: output, thread, usage, tool calls (`{ id, name, arguments }`), `status` and `traceId`, plus `reasoning`, `pendingApprovals`, `structured`, `structuredError`, `truncated`, `blocked` and `iterationLimitReached` when they apply, never the system prompt, the history, trace spans or a paused run's checkpoint. `AgentStreamSession` builds the events of a streamed run: `start` and `finish` name the run's thread (a new one when the request sent none), parts close before a tool call, an answer given in one piece is sent as text, and `finish` carries the run's outcome. `parseRunRequest()` takes an `acceptContext` policy that refuses `context` keys clients may not set (none by default), `parseAddMessageRequest()` refuses roles the server does not accept (`system` by default), and `parseResumeRequest()` and `parseWorkflowRunRequest()` (which refuses `checkpoint: true`) join them. `refuseNonJsonBody()`, `parseJsonBody()` and `readJsonRequestBody()` refuse bodies that are not JSON with `415`, `withSwarm()` closes a swarm once its run ends, `swarmAgentNames()` lists every agent of a swarm, router and pipeline stages included, and `CONFORMANCE_CASES` with `ConformanceRuntime` and `checkConformance()` let an adapter's tests check it answers like every other.

### Patch Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - CommonJS consumers can load the packages again. The exports maps only had an `import` condition, so `require('@cogitator-ai/core')` from NestJS, Jest in CommonJS mode or a script outside `"type": "module"` failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, although Node 22.12+ can `require()` these ES modules. Every entry now ends with a `default` condition pointing at the same file.

  - @cogitator-ai/types@0.36.0

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#110](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/110) [`a74da9a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/a74da9aa11d338175c7a929fedb98d887e078406) - Close the code scanning findings that were real. `webScrape` reads HTML with a linear tokenizer instead of chained regular expressions, so a hostile page can no longer block the event loop (200 KB of unclosed tags took over 20 seconds). It decodes each entity once (an escaped `&amp;lt;` no longer turns into `<`), treats `script` and `style` content as raw text the way browsers do, keeps a `>` inside a quoted attribute in its tag, matches `.class` selectors by class name and nested elements by depth, puts multi-line link text on one line, and drops `javascript:`, `data:` and `vbscript:` links in any letter case. A run or swarm timeout beyond what a timer can hold (about 24.8 days) no longer aborts the run at once, and the HTTP adapters refuse such a swarm `timeout` with 400. The `random_string` tool picks characters without modulo bias. Regular expressions that ran in polynomial time on crafted input (env interpolation, JSON fences, model ids, the injection classifier, the knowledge graph query tokenizer and others) are now linear. The a2a error log passes its context as an argument instead of building the format string from it.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [`9d40b76`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9d40b763f9fb25f9cb7cb2aba8a52ff2989fc5e9) - The `finish` event of a stream now carries the same usage as the JSON run response. The protocol's `Usage` type gains the optional `reasoningTokens`, `cachedInputTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens` (`RunUsage` is now the same type), and `createFinishEvent` passes its usage through `toRunUsage`, so a run's `RunResult.usage` can be given as is: the event keeps the counts the model reported and leaves out the run's cost and duration, exactly like the JSON answer. Before, a client streaming a run lost the reasoning and cache token counts that `/run` returned. The OpenAPI document gains a shared `RunUsage` schema, used by `AgentRunResponse` and by the new `StreamFinishEvent`.

- [`1c16684`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/1c16684976705ab5c34778728f27f7efd247242f) - One run contract for every server adapter. `parseRunRequest` and `parseSwarmRunRequest` validate the body of agent and swarm runs (an `input` of only whitespace is refused, so a request that says nothing never reaches the model), `RUN_INPUT_SCHEMA` and `NON_BLANK_PATTERN` give schema-driven adapters the same rule, and `isNonBlankString` checks a single value. `toRunUsage` and the `RunUsage` type describe the usage of a run answer, now with the optional `reasoningTokens`, `cachedInputTokens` and `cacheWriteTokens`. `DEFAULT_SSE_HEARTBEAT_MS`, `encodeHeartbeat`, `resolveSseHeartbeatMs` and `startHeartbeat` let SSE streams write a comment every 5 seconds while a run is silent. The OpenAPI document now states that `input` must contain more than whitespace and lists the three optional usage counts.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- 65d0cc0: Swagger UI calls the right URLs and offers a bearer token when the server checks credentials. The spec's `servers` now defaults to where the routes are mounted (Express `basePath`, the Hono/Koa mount prefix), and with `auth` configured the spec declares `bearerAuth` as an optional requirement (`swagger.auth` overrides it). The Swagger page escapes the title and the embedded spec, so agent names and descriptions can't inject markup.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bee3ef: Reasoning models and prompt caching work the same way on every provider.

  - **Reasoning.** `reasoning: { effort, budgetTokens?, summary? }` on an agent, a run or a `ChatRequest` (`effort` from `none` to `max`). Anthropic and Bedrock get adaptive thinking with the closest effort the Claude model accepts (`disabled` / `between_tools` / lowest effort for `none`, a thinking budget on Claude 3.7 – 4.5); OpenAI gets `reasoning.effort` and summaries; OpenAI-compatible servers `reasoning_effort`; Gemini `thinkingLevel` (3+) or `thinkingBudget` (2.5) with `includeThoughts`; Ollama `think`. The summary comes back as `ChatResponse.reasoning` / `delta.reasoning`, `RunResult.reasoning` and `onReasoning`; server adapters, Next.js handlers and hooks, and the AI SDK adapter stream it as `reasoning-start` / `reasoning-delta` / `reasoning-end` parts.
  - **Thinking across tool calls.** Claude thinking blocks (Anthropic and Bedrock) are kept with the tool calls they preceded and sent back during the tool loop — only after the latest user message, since they are bound to the conversation that produced them — and a request whose replayed blocks the API refuses is retried once without them.
  - **Prompt caching.** Agent runs cache by default (`llm.promptCache`, `false` turns it off): Anthropic requests carry `cache_control`, Bedrock requests cache points; every backend reports `usage.cachedInputTokens` / `cacheWriteTokens` / `reasoningTokens`. `@cogitator-ai/models` prices cache reads and writes (`inputCached`, new `inputCacheWrite`, `calculateCost()`), so run costs account for them.

  **Fixes:** Anthropic and Bedrock `inputTokens` now include cache reads and writes (they counted only uncached input); Gemini `outputTokens` now include thinking tokens (`thoughtsTokenCount`), which were billed but not counted.

- 7bee3ef: Runs pause for a person to approve sensitive tool calls and continue later.

  - A tool with `requiresApproval` never runs without a decision. `RunOptions.onApproval` (or `guardrails.onToolApproval`) decides inline; otherwise the run pauses before executing the turn and returns `status: 'paused'`, `pendingApprovals` and a JSON `checkpoint`. `cogitator.resume(agent, threadId | checkpoint, { decisions, defaultDecision, userId })` executes the approved calls, answers declined ones with the reason, and goes on. A new message on the thread instead declines the waiting calls.
  - Paused runs are kept per thread in the memory adapter's thread metadata (`ThreadRunCheckpointStore`), in process memory without memory (`InMemoryRunCheckpointStore`), or in `runCheckpoints`. Resuming by thread checks the caller (`THREAD_ACCESS_DENIED`); a thread with nothing paused answers the new `RUN_NOT_PAUSED` (409).
  - `agentAsTool` passes the caller's `userId` to the delegated run and declines its approvals unless given `onApproval`, instead of reporting a paused sub-run as success.
  - Server adapters answer paused runs with `status` / `pendingApprovals` (never the checkpoint), stream `approval-required`, and take `POST /agents/:name/resume` (plus a WebSocket `resume` message); Next.js has `createResumeHandler` and `pendingApprovals` / `approve()` / `deny()` in its hooks; channels ask in the chat and resume on "approve" / "deny <reason>" (also "да" / "нет").

  **Behaviour change:** `requiresApproval` used to be enforced only with constitutional guardrails and an `onToolApproval` callback; without them such tools ran unasked. They now pause the run. WebSocket `complete` events no longer include a paused run's checkpoint.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- ed996c4: One agent can serve many users without them seeing each other's conversations or memory.

  - **Threads have owners.** The run that creates a thread records its `userId` (`thread.metadata.userId`). A run that passes a `threadId` continues it only for its owner and otherwise fails with the new `THREAD_ACCESS_DENIED` (403) before any history is loaded; a thread that cannot be read fails with `MEMORY_READ_FAILED` instead of being recreated without its owner. `RunOptions.threadAccess: 'shared'` opts out for threads your server derives itself (channels uses it, so group chats keep working). `assertThreadAccess`, `ensureThreadAccess`, `threadOwner` and `threadMetadata` are exported for your own endpoints.
  - **Memory is scoped by user.** `ContextBuilder.build({ userId })` leaves out facts, embeddings and knowledge graph nodes whose `metadata.userId` belongs to someone else; memory without an owner stays shared. The vector search filters in the adapter (`filter.userId` on the in-memory, Postgres and Qdrant adapters), so other users' memories cannot crowd out the user's own. Agent runs build the context for their `userId`, and the runtime now hands the context builder the memory adapter's facts and embeddings and the `memory.embedding` service, so `includeFacts`, `includeSemanticContext` and the `relevant`/`hybrid` strategies work in runs.
  - **Swarms and worker jobs** carry `userId` (`SwarmRunOptions.userId`, `addAgentJob(..., { userId })`) to every agent run.
  - **Server adapters** scope `/threads/:id` (read, append, clear) to the authenticated user and pass it to agent, stream, WebSocket and swarm runs. hono and koa now pass `auth`'s `userId` to runs at all (HTTP and WebSocket); next answers a run's `CogitatorError` with its status and `code` instead of 500, and chat streams cancel the run on client disconnect even after the Request object is no longer referenced. The shared OpenAPI spec lists the 403 of `/threads/:id` and agent runs.

  **Behaviour change:** threads created before, or by runs without a `userId`, have no owner and are open only to callers without one. Hand such a thread to a user by setting `metadata.userId` with `updateThread`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking:** requires Node.js 22.12 or newer (Node 20 reached end of life).
