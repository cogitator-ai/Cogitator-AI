### Minor Changes

- [#139](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/139) [`95d5866`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/95d58666629772419cf200daf120542cbe9289fa) - Cogitator Studio, a local debugger for agent projects: an overview of the project with its runs, success rate, spend, latency and daily activity, chat with every agent of the registry with streamed Markdown answers, highlighted code, LaTeX math, reasoning, tool calls and threads, approve or reject tool calls that need it, read each run as a waterfall of model calls, tool calls and nested agents with tokens and cost, and open any span for its details, run workflows with live node statuses and rerun them from a node, fork a finished run from any step with a changed input, context or tool result and compare both branches. A command palette (`⌘K`) reaches every agent, workflow, run and action, keyboard shortcuts cover the rest, and the light and dark themes follow the system. The project runs in a child process that reloads on save, and the history is kept in `.cogitator/studio/`.
