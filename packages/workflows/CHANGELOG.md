### Minor Changes

- [#310](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/310) [`74439c2`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/74439c22cce3f000a35a104392b6d290dbb3327d) - Triggers, routines and the inbox, experimental: a saved task on an agent or a workflow starts itself on a cron schedule, an API call or a webhook of GitHub, email or Slack, and what it comes to lands in an inbox. Every scheduler of the runtime now runs on one core.

  Every new entry point carries the `experimental_` prefix and is listed in `docs/EXPERIMENTAL_API.md`. Without `experimental_triggers` a runtime has no trigger manager and behaves as before.

  One scheduler core (types, core, channels, workflows):

  - `experimental_createCronEngine` over `cron-parser` (5 or 6 fields, `@daily` and the other presets, IANA time zones, the skipped hour of daylight saving fired at the first minute after it, the repeated hour once) and `planOccurrences` for catch-up (`latest`, `none`, `all`, with a window). `cron-parser` is an optional peer of the core, loaded on first use, `experimental_loadCronEngine()`: a trigger manager or scheduler without cron expressions never loads it.
  - `experimental_TimerClaims` and `experimental_TimerPoller`: the one claim, renew and release logic over the `TimerStore` contract, and `experimental_Scheduler` on top of it (cron, one-shot and interval entries, retries, `update` or `append` rescheduling, pause, resume, run now).
  - `getNextCronMs` and `HeartbeatScheduler` of channels, and the cron helpers, `TimerManager`, `JobScheduler` and `CronTriggerExecutor` of workflows are clients of it, with their public API and the workflow presets kept. `InMemoryTimerStore` and `FileTimerStore` moved to the core (workflows exports the same classes), and `FileTimerStore` now sees what other processes wrote and locks its file while it writes.
  - `TimerEntry` gained `trigger`, `catchUp`, `catchUpWindowMs` and `lastOccurrence`.

  Triggers and routines (types, core, config):

  - `CogitatorConfig.experimental_triggers` and `cog.experimental_triggers` (`experimental_TriggerManager`): routines (`prompt`, a target agent or workflow, `session`, `overlap` `skip`, `queue`, `parallel` or `replace`, `maxConcurrent`, `catchUp`, `owner`, `notify`) and their triggers: `cron` (with `timezone`), `api` (a bearer token the manager issues and keeps as its SHA-256, `issueToken`, `rotateToken`, or one from the environment), `webhook` (HMAC over the raw body), `github` (`X-Hub-Signature-256`, events and field filters, `ping`), `email` (Mailgun signature, Postmark and SendGrid secret) and `slack` (signature, URL verification, bot messages ignored). `maxPerHour` per trigger.
  - The routine's prompt is the task, what the event carries follows it in a `<trigger-payload untrusted="true">` block the payload cannot close, and the event is kept with the input in the session log as `metadata.trigger` (`RunOptions.inputMetadata`).
  - A firing starts one run: deliveries are deduplicated by their id in the routine store with a TTL (a GitHub delivery by a digest of its signed body, since its headers are not signed), each Mailgun signature starts one run at most, the run id is made from the trigger and the occurrence (`trg_<routine>.<trigger>.<occurrence>`, unique per trigger) and claimed, and with `durable` a second start finds the run held. Two runtimes sharing their stores start each cron occurrence once. Durable runs of routines and agent tasks a stopped process left are continued on `start()`, and every half lease after it while their lease still runs, from the runs the store keeps going on rather than the history.
  - Routine stores (routines made at run time, trigger state changed in one atomic `patchTriggerState` step, history, runs going on, claims): `experimental_InMemoryRoutineStore`, `experimental_FileRoutineStore`, `experimental_RedisRoutineStore`, `experimental_PostgresRoutineStore` (which sweeps expired claims). Saved routines name their target and take secrets as `{ env }`, and so do routines a config file or an isolated plugin sends as JSON. `experimental_fileTriggerStores()` puts routines, schedules and the inbox in `.cogitator/triggers` for a runtime and the CLI to share.
  - The inbox: `experimental_Inbox` over `experimental_InMemoryInboxStore`, `experimental_FileInboxStore`, `experimental_RedisInboxStore` or `experimental_PostgresInboxStore`, items of kind `result`, `approval`, `question` and `failure`, sinks (`experimental_webhookSink`, signed), live changes with `subscribe()`. Runs waiting for a person are answered with `respond()`, the answer claimed once in the store (`InboxItem.answeredAt`, `claimAnswer`), so archiving an item does not answer it and two answers resume a run once. An answer resumes only the run its item waits on (another run of the thread that paused since is left alone), and an answer whose run could not be taken up (an answer its question's schema refuses among them) is given back. An item a run ends with has an id made from the run, and one the inbox store could not take waits in the run's record (`ActiveRoutineRun.pendingItems`) and is written again until it is in. The inbox pages by time and id (`InboxFilter.beforeId`), the Redis inbox reads a page of an index per user and status. The `Notification` hooks hear `routine_result` and `routine_failed`.
  - Agents schedule themselves: `triggers.schedulerTools(agent)` gives an agent `schedule_task`, `list_tasks` and `cancel_task` whose tasks the manager runs on it in the thread they were given in, the description read back as data. An occurrence is skipped while the last run of its task goes on, a one-shot task is held (not fired) while its run goes on, without holding up the poll, and a run that failed makes it due again after a backoff, up to the scheduler's retries, and a task that waits for approval or an answer comes to the inbox for `respond()`.
  - Plugins register routines and triggers with `registerRoutine` and `registerTrigger`, also from an isolated process, given the permission `Routine` in their manifest, without `userId`, `owner` or a thread of their own, on agents and workflows `experimental_triggers.pluginTargets` lists. A routine's run holds a lease on the plugins.
  - New error codes `TRIGGER_NOT_FOUND` (404) and `INBOX_ITEM_ANSWERED` (409). The config package reads `experimental_triggers` from files (`TriggersConfigSchema`), the routine schemas are in types (`RoutineSchema`, `TriggerSpecSchema`).

  Channels: `experimental_channelSink` tells a routine's owner in their chat, `experimental_emailTriggerParser` reads mail for email triggers as the email channel does. The heartbeat keeps its fixed delay on the scheduler core: the next time of a repeating task counts from the end of its run (`SchedulerOptions.nextFire` is called after the occurrences fired). The heartbeat's task text is wrapped as untrusted data the agent wrote earlier, and `verifyGitHubSignature`, `verifyMailgunSignature` and `secretsEqual` are the core's.

  Workflows: `experimental_routineWorkflow` runs a workflow as a routine's target from `{ input, trigger }` (the wrapped prompt and what the manager vouches for, not the raw event), its human approvals in the inbox (one item per request, the assignee's, closed by a timeout or an escalation, `experimental_approvalItemId`) and answered through the trigger manager, nodes that finally fail in the inbox (`experimental_inboxNotifier`, `experimental_inboxDeadLetterQueue`). `DefaultTriggerManager.start()` brings back the triggers of its store, and `register()` of a trigger it brought back (same workflow, type and config) takes that one over instead of adding a duplicate, so a program that registers its triggers on every boot keeps one of each (functions of the config, such as an event trigger's `filter`, count by identity, and only the config's own `enabled` is left out of the comparison), and does not start it again, so `runImmediately` fires once per start. `JobScheduler` refuses an invalid cron expression or time zone and reports runs it could not schedule (`onError`).

  Server adapters: with `triggers` (the runtime's trigger manager) express, fastify, hono, koa, tetsu and next serve `POST /triggers/:id/fire` and `POST /triggers/:id/webhook` (the raw body handed over untouched, before the adapter's auth, up to 10 MiB) and `GET /inbox` and `PATCH /inbox/:id` (the caller's own items, `401` for a caller without a user id unless the adapter is set to `anonymous: 'allow'` explicitly, pages by `before` and `beforeId`). Next gets `createTriggerHandler` and `createInboxHandler`. Shared handlers, OpenAPI paths and a conformance suite live in server-shared.

  Studio: Inbox (live, read, archive, approve, reject, answer questions and workflow requests in the form their type asks for, also through `POST /approvals/:id`) and Schedules (start, stop, run now, pause, resume, history). The Plugins page lists the routines a plugin registered.

  CLI: `cogitator schedule list | add | rm | run | pause | resume`, `cogitator inbox [--unread] | show | read | unread | archive` and `cogitator trigger fire | token`.

  Breaking changes and migration:

  - `schedule_task` (`createSchedulerTools`) checks a cron expression with the cron engine instead of a 5-field pattern: `@daily`, 6 fields and a new `timezone` parameter are taken, and the first run of a cron task is the expression's first occurrence instead of one minute after it was scheduled. A runtime that uses it without channels or workflows needs `cron-parser` installed (`npm install cron-parser`) or a `cron` engine passed in, a cron task fails with `CONFIGURATION_ERROR` otherwise. `list_tasks` and `cancel_task` leave the schedules of routines in the same store alone. The answer of `schedule_task` may also carry `timezone`.
  - `schedule_task` schedules a task for the user of the run that called it (else `defaultUserId`): a `userId` argument other than the run's fails the tool instead of scheduling for that user. At most `maxTasks` tasks wait at once, 20 unless set (`Infinity` for no limit), and a cron task runs at most once a minute (read from its computed occurrences, presets such as `@secondly` included).
  - The message `HeartbeatScheduler` sends for a task no longer starts with `[SCHEDULED TASK]`: the description comes in a `<trigger-payload source="agent" untrusted="true">` block, and `raw.trigger` carries the event. Code that read the old text reads `raw.taskId` or `raw.trigger.text`.
  - `RunNotification.type` has two more values, `routine_result` and `routine_failed`: an exhaustive `switch` over it needs the new cases.
  - `PluginContributions` has `routines` and `PluginContext` has `registerRoutine` and `registerTrigger`: a hand-written object of either type adds them.
  - `DefaultTriggerManager.start()` returns a promise that resolves once the triggers of its store are back. Code that calls it without `await` still works.
  - `JobScheduler.registerCronJob()` and `scheduleRun()` with an invalid cron expression or time zone throw `VALIDATION_ERROR`, and a cron job whose run could not be scheduled is reported to `onError` (else logged) instead of being dropped silently.
  - `CronTriggerExecutor` keeps the latest 100 missed occurrences when more were missed, instead of the oldest.
  - `FileTimerStore` writes `timers.json` with mode 0600 under a lock file next to it.

### Patch Changes

- [#293](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/293) [`2da3c07`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/2da3c07a7409c6785d3dfdac276fa94f5ed8f9f8) - Steer a run while it goes on, choose what a second message does to a busy thread, pause a run on a question a tool asks, and cancel a run without losing what it showed or did.

  Behavior changes, none of which needs a code change:

  - An aborted run (its `signal`, its timeout, `handle.abort()` or a newer run that interrupts it) now leaves more in its thread: the text it already streamed as an assistant message with `metadata.interrupted: true`, the results of tool calls that finished before the abort, and `Aborted before dispatch` for the calls it never started. Before, it left only its `interrupt` entry. A tool that ignores the signal still runs on, its late result is never written.
  - History read from memory now answers a tool call left without a result (a crash, an abort while the tool ran) with `The run stopped before this tool call returned: outcome unknown, verify before retrying`, instead of dropping the call from the assistant message. The model learns the call may have run. The log is not rewritten. Code that sends `history` of its own is not affected.
  - A paused run's `output` is the text of its last assistant message. For a pause on approvals this is what it always was.

  New:

  - `cog.start(agent, options)` returns a `RunHandle`: `steer(message)` adds a user message after the current step's tool calls (none is skipped) and wakes an agent about to stop, `followUp(message)` runs once the agent would stop (with a fresh `maxIterations`), `inject(message)` adds context to the next model call without waking the agent (one left at the end is saved to the thread), `abort(reason?)` stops the run and returns what it did not deliver, and `result` is what `run()` returns. `queue: { steering, followUp }` takes queued messages `'one-at-a-time'` (default) or `'all'` at once. Delivered messages are saved as `message` entries with `metadata.queued`, so a later run reads them as history, and a run that pauses returns the rest in `result.undelivered`. `run()` is unchanged.
  - `multitaskStrategy` (`RunOptions`, or `CogitatorConfig` for every run) says what a run does when another run of the runtime goes on in its thread, with the names of LangGraph's `multitask_strategy`: `enqueue` waits, `reject` fails with `THREAD_BUSY` (409), `interrupt` aborts the running one (it fails with `RUN_INTERRUPTED`, 409), `rollback` interrupts it and runs on a branch from where it started, so the thread goes on as if it never happened. Unset, runs of one thread go on side by side as before. A run started from a tool call of the run going on is never held back, other runs of the same trace follow the strategy.
  - Tools pause a run to ask a person with `context.interrupt({ reason, message, responseSchema, expiresAt })`. The run returns `status: 'paused'` with the question in `result.interrupts` (`id`, `kind: 'input'`, `reason`, `message`, `responseSchema` as JSON Schema, `expiresAt`, `toolCallId`, `toolName`), and `cog.resume(agent, thread, { responses: { [id]: answer } })` checks the answer against the schema and runs the tool again, where `interrupt()` returns it, parsed by a Zod schema. A wrong answer fails the resume with `INTERRUPT_ANSWER_INVALID` (400, `details.interruptId`), one after `expiresAt` with `INTERRUPT_EXPIRED` (410), and the run still waits. Finished calls of the same step keep their results. The pause and the resume are logged as `interrupt` entries (`status: 'paused' | 'resumed'`).
  - The run result wire format (`toAgentWireRunResult`) keeps `interrupts`, and `AgentRunPausedError` says when a workflow node or a swarm turn paused on questions instead of approvals.
  - Tool calls of a step run one after another, and the step stops at the first question: the calls after it run once the answer came. With `parallelToolCalls: true` the other calls run before the answer. Calls that finished keep their results, the checkpoint lists them in `turn.completed`, and a handoff among them hands over once the resumed step is done. A resume that leaves a question unanswered pauses on it again as it was asked, its tool not run again and its `expiresAt` unchanged. Answers are checked with the tool's Zod schema (refinements included) while the process that asked keeps it, else with the stored JSON Schema of the schema's input side.
  - A run with a `multitaskStrategy` is refused with `THREAD_ACCESS_DENIED` before it touches another user's run going on in the thread. A follow-up or steering message starts a new task, so its first tool call is never taken for a duplicate. `handle.abort()` is final: what it returns was never delivered or saved, also when it comes after the last model turn.
  - Queued messages pass the run's `beforeRun` input checks (PII in `block` mode, prompt injection, input guardrails, your own hooks) before they reach the model or the thread, injected messages saved at the end too. A refused message is dropped and listed in `handle.refused` with its error (`onRefusedMessage` in the options of `start()`), the run goes on.
  - A question that expired without an answer no longer holds the run: a resume answers its tool call with `Nobody answered "<message>" before it expired`, so other questions of the step can be answered alone. Calls of a step that never ran get "Not started" when the user moves on. A run whose signal aborted already, and a run of another user on a thread whose run has not written anything yet, change nothing on the thread.
  - `saveInterruptedReply: false` keeps an aborted run from saving its streamed text, and the voice runner uses it, so an interrupted voice turn keeps only what the caller heard, as before.
  - Resume a checkpoint with the same or a newer version: from this release the turn of a pause on a question lists all its calls, the finished ones in `turn.completed`, and an older version would run those again. The checkpoint stays `version: 1`.
  - `multitaskStrategy` is part of the config schema, so `defineConfig()` and `cogitator.yml` keep it.
  - Approvals are interrupts of `kind: 'approval'` keyed by tool call id: `result.interrupts` lists them, and `responses` decides them as `decisions` does. `decisions`, `defaultDecision` and `pendingApprovals` work as before. `RunCheckpoint` stays `version: 1` with optional `interrupts` and `iterationLimit`, older checkpoints resume as they did.
  - `@cogitator-ai/core` exports `ABORTED_BEFORE_DISPATCH`, `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, `repairUnansweredToolCalls()`, `APPROVAL_RESPONSE_SCHEMA` and `isToolInterrupt()` (rethrow it from a `wrapToolCall` middleware that catches tool errors). `@cogitator-ai/types` adds `RunHandle`, `StartOptions`, `QueuedRunMessage`, `MultitaskStrategy`, `RunInterrupt`, `InterruptRequest`, `ToolContext.interrupt` and the error codes `THREAD_BUSY`, `RUN_INTERRUPTED` and `INTERRUPT_EXPIRED`.
  - Server adapters (Express, Fastify, Hono, Koa, Tetsu, Next.js) take `multitaskStrategy` in run, stream and WebSocket run requests and `responses` in resume requests. A paused run that waits on questions of its tools carries them in `interrupts` of the JSON answer, the `finish` event and the WebSocket `complete` event, and its stream sends the new `interrupt-required` event instead of `approval-required`. `@cogitator-ai/server-shared` adds `runRequestRunOptions()`, `MULTITASK_STRATEGIES`, `createInterruptRequiredEvent()`, `toPendingInterrupts()`, `PendingInterrupt` and their schemas, and the OpenAPI document lists the new fields. `useCogitatorChat` keeps `pendingInterrupts`, calls `onInterruptRequired`, and resumes with `resume({ responses })`. With `multitaskStrategy: 'enqueue'` or `'reject'` it no longer aborts the request in flight when a new message is sent, and a refused message shows as an error without touching the running answer. Swarm routes ignore `multitaskStrategy` in every adapter. A stream refused or interrupted this way answers `200` with an `error` event carrying the code, the JSON routes `409` (`410` for `INTERRUPT_EXPIRED`).
  - The Gateway's `queueMode` takes the run strategies too: `enqueue` (the same as `sequential`), `reject` (a message for a busy thread runs nothing, reaches the new `message:rejected` hook, is never handed back to its channel, and makes `injectMessage` reject) and `rollback` (as `interrupt`, then the new message is answered on a branch from where the stopped answer started). Every gateway run names the strategy its queue mode stands for, so the runtime's `multitaskStrategy` never contradicts the queue (`parallel` names none). `sequential`, `parallel`, `interrupt` and `collect` work as before. Cogitator Studio labels pauses on questions and their answers in the thread tree.
  - Pauses on questions of tools never resume without answers anywhere. `pendingQuestions(result)` lists them, and `AgentRunPausedError` carries them in `interrupts`. A workflow `agentNode` fails with it, also with an approval store or `approvals: false`, where it used to resume without an answer forever. Swarm turns and queued workflow jobs fail the same way, and `JobQueue.resumeAgentJob` takes `responses`. The Gateway asks the question in the chat and takes the user's next message as the answer, and the voice runner says it and takes the caller's next turn. A2A tasks wait in `input-required` with an `interrupt-request` part and take the answer back (`A2AClient.answerQuestions()`). MCP servers ask through elicitation. The OpenAI-compatible APIs, Studio and delegated `agentAsTool` runs end with an error that names the questions, and the AI SDK provider warns with them (`providerMetadata.cogitator.pendingQuestions`).
  - `parseAnswer(text, schema)` and `answerFormat(schema)` (`@cogitator-ai/types`) read a typed or spoken answer by the question's schema and say what an answer looks like. `cog.pausedRun(threadId)` lists what a thread waits on, `cog.cancelPause(threadId, { userId, reason })` ends a pause with declined results. The Gateway shows the format with the question, tells a wrong answer in plain words, cancels a question with a cancel word (`approvals.cancelWords`, `cancel` by default) or after `approvals.maxAnswerAttempts` wrong answers (3), ends an expired one, and picks up a question waiting across a restart. The voice runner reads spoken answers the same way. A2A tasks keep their paused run by task, so a new task in the same context no longer answers the wrong run (the older task ends `canceled`), an expired question fails its task and lifts the pause, and text answers are read by the schema. MCP elicitation carries the schema's limits, asks again on a refused answer (3 times at most) and waits `elicitationTimeoutMs` (10 minutes by default) instead of 60 seconds.

### Minor Changes

- [#249](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/249) [`3f81cdb`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/3f81cdb928c80f4c70548911d4e6fd07cf2b1e52) - Workflow jobs in the worker run on the workflow executor with checkpointed retries, jobs take an id for safe re-adds, and workflow and swarm jobs report usage

  Workflow jobs run on the `WorkflowExecutor` of `@cogitator-ai/workflows`, now a dependency of the worker, with the same `SerializedWorkflow` graphs and node semantics (agent, transform, condition and parallel nodes, a graph with many roots starting at all of them). Nodes run in rounds, each running at once every node whose nodes before it all settled. A failing node aborts the agent runs next to it and the job fails once they settled.

  A workflow job keeps one checkpoint, saved over after every node under the job's id and `runId`, in `WorkerRuntime.checkpoints`, which `WorkerPool` defaults to a `RedisCheckpointStore` in its Redis under `<queue prefix>:<queue name>:workflow-checkpoints`, kept `checkpointTtl` seconds after the last save (7 days by default). A job BullMQ retries goes on from it instead of running its finished agent nodes again. The checkpoint is deleted once the run finished, and once no attempt follows a failure (the last attempt, a cancelled job, a paused agent run), while a job a shutdown stopped keeps it for the worker that takes the job up. `processWorkflowJob` called on its own runs without checkpoints unless `runtime.checkpoints` is given, and then takes `execution.willRetry(error)`. The run keeps its bookkeeping in state keys starting with `__cogitator:`, left out of the output, and input keys, node ids and output keys with that prefix are refused.

  `addAgentJob`, `resumeAgentJob`, `addWorkflowJob`, `addSwarmJob` and `addSwarmAgentJob` take a `jobId`: adding a job whose id the queue holds already returns that job instead of adding a second one, also when two adds race, so producers can retry an add. An id the queue removed adds a new job. An empty id, one with `:`, an integer, a name of the queue's own BullMQ keys and an id the queue holds as another kind of job are refused.

  `NodeContext.idempotencyKey` (`workflow:<workflowId>:node:<name>:visit:<n>`) stays the same when a node is retried or its run resumed and changes when the workflow comes back to the node, for external APIs that take an idempotency key.

  `WorkflowJobResult` and `SwarmJobResult` now always carry `usage` (`JobUsage`: tokens, cost and agent runs, by agent for swarms), so code that builds these results itself has to set it. The metrics count `cogitator_job_tokens_total`, `cogitator_job_input_tokens_total`, `cogitator_job_output_tokens_total` and `cogitator_job_cost_usd_total` of completed jobs by type (`MetricsCollector.recordUsage`).

  `RedisCheckpointStore` takes a `ttl` in seconds, for clients with `expire` and `zrangebyscore`. `WorkflowScheduler.runParallelWithCallback` waits for the tasks in flight before it rejects with the first failure, as `runParallel` does, so a per-node checkpointed run no longer fails while nodes next to the failing one still run.

### Minor Changes

- [#220](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/220) [`b42f62e`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/b42f62ecd300cd945c42a91014b1297bc4e10c43) - Telemetry follows the OpenTelemetry GenAI semantic conventions, and runs that belong together share one trace.

  - Spans carry `gen_ai.*` attributes next to the existing `llm.*`, `tool.*` and `run.*` ones: `invoke_agent` on `agent.run`, `chat` on model calls (provider, request parameters, response id, finish reasons, token usage with cache reads, cache writes and reasoning), `execute_tool` on tool calls. `GEN_AI` names them all.
  - Streamed model calls record `gen_ai.response.time_to_first_chunk`.
  - Trace and span ids are W3C ids (32 and 16 hex characters) instead of `trace_…` and `span_…`. Code that parsed the old prefixes needs to treat ids as opaque strings. `agent.run` is now an `internal` span instead of `server`.
  - `RunOptions.trace` puts a run under a given parent, with `parseTraceparent` and `formatTraceparent` for W3C headers. A run started inside a tool of another run joins that run's trace under the tool's span, and `withTraceContext` does the same for any code.
  - `registerTelemetry(observer)` watches every runtime of the process, and `cogitator.recordSpan()` reports spans of your own orchestration to a runtime's observers.
  - `telemetry: { captureContent: true }` in the config, or `captureContent: true` on an observer, records system instructions, input and output messages, tool definitions, and tool arguments and results on the spans in the convention's JSON shapes. Observers that did not ask for content never receive it.
  - The OTLP exporter sends the convention's span names (`chat gpt-5.5`, `execute_tool search`, `invoke_agent researcher`) and array attributes, and keeps the Cogitator name as `cogitator.span_name`.
  - Workflows put agent runs under their node span, or under a `workflow.run` (`invoke_workflow`) span reported to the runtime's observers when no workflow tracer is on. Workflows running at once on one tracer no longer nest into each other. The `LLM_*` span attribute constants of workflows are deprecated in favour of `GEN_AI`.
  - Swarms report a `swarm.run` (`invoke_workflow`) span and run their agents under it, distributed swarms on their workers too.
  - A paused run reports its `agent.run` span with status `unset`, and a resumed run continues its trace. Time travel and learning traces are stored under the run id, since runs can now share a trace id: `timeTravel.compare()` and `getCheckpoints()` take a run id, and still take a trace id that belongs to one recorded run.
  - A workflow tracer given a `traceparent` with sampling flags `00` (through `setContextFromHeaders`) now leaves the workflow unsampled, as the caller asked, and the trace a workflow runs in takes precedence over a header the tracer kept from an earlier request.
  - The studio's trace inspector shows the instructions, prompt and response of every model call.

Without `continueOnError` the first failed item now stops the map: no further item starts, the items in flight are aborted, and the error's `partialResults` report what each item really did (`MapItemSkippedError` for items that never started) instead of marking every item failed. The mapper gets a fourth argument `{ signal, attempt }`: the signal aborts on the item's `timeout`, on another item's failure and when the workflow run is cancelled or paused, and a timed-out attempt is aborted before the next one starts, so retries no longer overlap. `mapWorkflowNode` and `mapReduceWorkflowNode` pass the run's signal, and `executeMap`/`executeMapReduce` accept `{ signal }` as a third argument.

  - Worker agent jobs complete with `status: 'paused'`, the waiting calls and the checkpoint, and `JobQueue.resumeAgentJob(agentConfig, pausedResult, { decisions })` continues the run on any worker. Workflow and swarm jobs whose agent pauses fail without retries with an `AgentRunPausedError` instead of handing the model's text before the tool call to the next node.
  - `agentNode` asks for the waiting calls through the workflow's human-in-the-loop approval store (the `approvalStore` execute option, shaped by the new `approvals` option) and resumes the run once they are answered. Without a store, or with `approvals: false`, the node fails with an `AgentRunPausedError` that carries the checkpoint, and the executor does not retry it.
  - A swarm turn that pauses, local or distributed, fails with an `AgentRunPausedError` instead of answering with the pre-tool text. It is not retried, skipped or failed over and does not trip the circuit breaker.

The mapped arguments are validated against the tool's schema, the guardrails apply, a sandboxed tool runs in the runtime's sandbox and `tool.timeout` is kept. A tool with `requiresApproval` asks the workflow's approval store, like an `agentNode`, and runs only once the call is approved. Before, `toolNode` called `tool.execute` directly, so a tool that needs approval ran unasked. The node now needs the `Cogitator` the executor puts in its context, and the new `approvals` option and `NodeApprovalOptions` type shape the requests.

### Patch Changes

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - CommonJS consumers can load the packages again. The exports maps only had an `import` condition, so `require('@cogitator-ai/core')` from NestJS, Jest in CommonJS mode or a script outside `"type": "module"` failed with `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED`, although Node 22.12+ can `require()` these ES modules. Every entry now ends with a `default` condition pointing at the same file.

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - Idempotency keys of workflow nodes no longer change when a run resumes. The key used the scheduler's step, which starts again at 1 on resume, so a node that had already charged a card before the last checkpoint was run a second time. The key is now `workflow:<workflowId>:node:<name>:visit:<n>`, where `n` counts the runs of that node, and checkpoints record those counts in the new `WorkflowCheckpoint.nodeVisits` (passed back through `WorkflowExecuteOptions.nodeVisits`). Checkpoints saved before this change count each completed node once.

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - Pausing, cancelling or timing out a workflow run no longer writes the node it interrupted to the dead-letter queue, counts it as a failed node execution or reports it to `onNodeError`. Retrying such an entry while resuming the run executed the node, and everything after it, twice.

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - An agent turn that pauses on two identical calls of one tool now opens an approval request for each call. The requests were identified by their content only, so both calls shared one request and a single approval let both run. A `toolNode` names its call after the node and its visit, so a run that resumes after a restart still finds the answer given meanwhile. Node contexts gain `visit`, how many times the node has run in this workflow run.

- [#136](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/136) [`9593a4a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/9593a4a09422e082c619d991cafdfaf42bf20281) - A streaming reduce (`reduce.streaming: true`) with `successOnly: false` now reduces every item, failed ones included, as the non-streaming reduce does. Its condition skipped every item instead, so the result was the initial accumulator.

The attempt is recorded first and the entry is removed when the retry succeeds. `PostgresDLQ` stores the queue in Postgres (one table, created on first use, filters in SQL, `cleanupExpired()`), so failed nodes survive restarts and every process sees one queue. `retryDeadLetter` and `replay` take execute options, such as the `approvalStore` a retried run needs.

- [#110](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/pull/110) [`a74da9a`](https://github.com/cogitator-ai/Cogitator-AI/commit/a74da9aa11d338175c7a929fedb98d887e078406) - A human approval wait survives a restart. A request got a random id, so a run picked up again after a crash asked the same question twice and lost an answer given while the process was down. A request's id now comes from the run and the question, so a human node that runs again finds its own request: an answer given in the meantime is used at once, an open request is waited on without a second notification, and the timeout keeps counting from the original deadline. A node visited again in a loop asks about a changed state and opens a new request. `WorkflowManager.recoverRuns(options)` resumes the runs a stopped process left running or waiting from their last checkpoint. An escalation's id comes from the request it escalates and it keeps its own deadline, so a pending escalation is picked up too. `resume`, `replay` and `recoverRuns` start from the newest checkpoint saved for the run, even one the run record never heard of because the process stopped mid-flight.

The timer node swallowed the abort and returned `{ cancelled: true }`, so the run checkpointed it as done and `resume()` ran the following nodes at once, skipping the rest of the wait (an embargo of 3 s paused after 0.5 s released 2.4 s early). The node now fails with an `AbortError` like a human node does, so it is not checkpointed and a resumed run waits again. A persisted timer (`persist: true` with a `timerStore`) is cancelled in its store and marked as interrupted, and on resume the node waits only until the original `firesAt`. A persisted timer cancelled through its store while the node waits (`TimerManager.cancel`) now reports `cancelled: true` and `onCancelled` instead of `onFired`.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 25af97f: `WorkflowManager` no longer overwrites a paused or cancelled run with `failed`, and `resume()` now actually continues a paused run from its last checkpoint (reusing the options it was started with, or new ones passed as a second argument); pausing requires a `checkpointStore`. Scheduled runs now get the manager's checkpoint store, tracer, metrics and `defaultTimeout`, honour `ScheduleOptions.timeout` and retry up to `ScheduleOptions.maxRetries` times, and the manager exposes `registerCronJob`, `unregisterCronJob`, `setCronJobEnabled` and `getCronJobs` for recurring runs.
- ae26101: The run callbacks `onApprovalRequired`, `onTimerScheduled`, `onDeadLetter`, `onCompensationStart` and `onCompensationComplete` are now called by the executor and the manager. Nodes can declare a saga rollback with `config.compensation`: when a later node fails, the executor compensates the completed nodes (reverse order by default) before returning the error.

### Patch Changes

- e7445e2: Cron triggers registered with `catchUp: true` now fire every occurrence that passed while their timer was late (system sleep, a blocked event loop), each with its own timestamp, instead of skipping them.
- ae26101: `WorkflowExecutor.resume()` and `stream()` accept the full executor options (`signal`, `tracer`, `metricsCollector`, stores, ...), and runs without their own tracer or metrics collector now use the ones set with `setGlobalTracer` / `setGlobalMetrics` when those are enabled.
- 1a41760: `humanWorkflowNode` outputs `withdrawn`, and `escalated` is now true when a timed-out request was answered by its `escalateTo` assignee. `subworkflowWorkflowNode` with `onError: 'catch'` keeps the parent running and outputs `{ error: { name, message } }` instead of failing it, and `parallelSubworkflowsNode` accepts configs typed with the child state.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 3d08d05: Approvals settle once. The first answer to a request wins in every store — in-memory, file, Redis and Postgres, atomically across processes — and a later `submitResponse` throws `ApprovalAlreadyAnsweredError` with the answer that stands; a human node whose timeout fires just after someone answered keeps that answer. Deleting (or expiring) a request nobody answered withdraws it: waiters, in this process or another, get a withdrawal and the node finishes with `withdrawn: true` instead of waiting forever. A timeout or withdrawal no longer counts as approval for `multi-choice` requests, where any decision value did.
- 57ac053: Timer claims belong to the store instance that took them. `TimerStore` gains optional `claimTtl`, `renew(id)` and `release(id)`, which `RedisTimerStore` and `PostgresTimerStore` implement (Postgres adds a `claimed_by` column, also to existing tables). `TimerManager` renews a claim right before a handler starts and every `claimTtl / 3` while it runs, so a handler slower than the lease no longer lets another worker run the same timer; it skips a timer whose claim another worker took while it waited and reports it through the new `onClaimLost` option. A timer without a handler, or beyond a poll's `batchSize`, is released so another manager can take it right away. A failed handler still keeps the claim until the lease ends, which spaces out retries.
- 802388e: Runs, approvals and timers can live in Redis or Postgres, like checkpoints: `RedisRunStore` / `PostgresRunStore`, `RedisApprovalStore` / `PostgresApprovalStore` and `RedisTimerStore` / `PostgresTimerStore` take an existing `@cogitator-ai/redis` client or ioredis, or a `pg` Pool, and create their tables on first use. Run queries, counts and stats run in the database (Postgres) or on sorted-set indexes (Redis); a human node waiting in one process resumes when another process answers (polled every `pollInterval`); and overdue timers are claimed for `claimTtl`, so several `TimerManager`s can share a store without firing a timer twice and a crashed worker's timers come back. All Postgres stores, the checkpoint store included, now survive two processes creating their tables at the same moment.

### Patch Changes

- 4c46b22: `humanNode`, `approvalNode`, `choiceNode`, `inputNode`, `ratingNode`, `chainNode` and `managementChain` return `NamedHumanNodeConfig` — the config with its `name` known to be set — so `config.name` can be passed where a string is required.
- 6b16db1: `InMemoryRunStore` hands out copies of runs, so changing a returned run's node or tag lists no longer changes the stored run, and `list()` without filters is sorted like `list({})` (newest started first), matching the Redis and Postgres stores. `WorkflowRunStats` documents that cancelled runs count toward neither the success nor the failure rate.
- 8d2d1bf: `WorkflowManager` records `currentNodes`, `completedNodes` and `failedNodes` for scheduled and triggered runs too (it did only for `execute()`), and a run's record holds every node update by the time the run is marked finished.
- 35701f9: Workflow typing fixes. `addLoop` conditions receive the builder's state type, like `addConditional`, instead of `unknown`. `executeParallelSubworkflows`, `parallelSubworkflows`, `fanOutFanIn` and `scatterGather` carry the child workflow state (`CS`), so a typed child workflow fits without casts. `'noop'` is a valid tracing exporter, and `WorkflowTracer.isSampled()` is `false` with a sample rate of 0.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 4964fb6: Workflow checkpoints in Redis and Postgres, and resuming that resumes.

  - `RedisCheckpointStore` (an `@cogitator-ai/redis` client or ioredis) and `PostgresCheckpointStore` (a `pg` Pool; creates its table on first use) keep checkpoints where any process can resume them.
  - **Fixes:** `WorkflowExecutor.resume()` ran finished nodes again when they followed another finished node, and nodes after a finished node lost its output as their input; both are fixed (`WorkflowExecuteOptions.nodeResults` carries the outputs). Checkpoints saved in the same millisecond now get increasing timestamps, so "latest" is the latest. `WorkflowManager.replay(workflow, runId, node)` runs the node and everything after it again (it used to skip some of them) with the earlier nodes' results, and a manager with a `checkpointStore` checkpoints its runs by default, so they can be replayed.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- Nodes with `config.timeout` now cancel the timed-out attempt: each attempt gets its own AbortSignal (linked to the run signal) that is aborted with the `NodeTimeoutError`. Previously agent nodes kept their LLM request running in the background after a timeout, and retries stacked parallel generations.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Joins were broken: a join node could run once per arriving branch, the first time before slower branches had finished. A reachability-based join barrier fixes this. Entry-point detection in the builder was inverted: only the first of several independent roots ran, and a root addParallel was skipped. Subworkflow child failures were reported as success; they now propagate, and timeouts abort the child. Per-node timeout, retries and retryDelay were ignored and are now enforced. Run-level policies are honoured: defaultRetry, defaultCircuitBreaker, deadLetterQueue, idempotencyStore, approval/timer stores, and the manager's defaultTimeout. The run signal reaches agent and tool nodes, and a tracer and metricsCollector can be passed. New adapters (timerWorkflowNode, humanWorkflowNode, mapWorkflowNode, mapReduceWorkflowNode, subworkflowWorkflowNode, parallelSubworkflowsNode) make the documented helpers usable inside a workflow. Conditionals can target any construct, the scheduler uses an order-preserving pool, and the trigger manager and checkpoint store no longer swallow errors. README rewritten with type-checked snippets; docs updated; examples 01-03 verified with Gemini.

  **Breaking changes**
  - Builds with several independent root nodes now throw; previously only the first root silently ran
  - A root addParallel is now the entry point
  - Nodes placed after a loop must be its back or exit node, otherwise the build throws
  - Subworkflow child failures now fail the parent subworkflow node
  - addNode accepts a WorkflowNode as well as a NodeFn (additive)

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- feat(workflows): implement ParallelEdge support in WorkflowBuilder

  Added `addParallel()` method to WorkflowBuilder for creating parallel fan-out edges:

  ```typescript
  const workflow = new WorkflowBuilder<MyState>('parallel-workflow')
    .addNode('start', async () => ({ output: 'ready' }))
    .addParallel('fanout', ['a', 'b', 'c'], { after: ['start'] })
    .addNode('a', async () => ({ output: 'a' }))
    .addNode('b', async () => ({ output: 'b' }))
    .addNode('c', async () => ({ output: 'c' }))
    .addNode('merge', async (ctx) => ({ output: ctx.input }), {
      after: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    })
    .build();
  ```

  - Parallel nodes execute concurrently (respects maxConcurrency)
  - Fan-in support: merge node receives array of outputs from parallel branches
  - Works with existing conditional and loop edges
