# @cogitator-ai/evals

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 27789fc: The `run_eval` tool ran the whole dataset even with `maxCases` and reported `assertionsPassed: true` for limited runs. `EvalSuite.run({ maxCases })` now executes only the first `maxCases` cases, and the tool passes the limit through and reports the real assertion results.

### Patch Changes

- 27789fc: Judge configs had to set `temperature` in TypeScript although the schema defines a default, and that default was never applied. `judge` now takes `JudgeConfigInput` with an optional `temperature`, and the suite resolves it to 0 when it is omitted.
- fd688a0: `threshold` and `noRegression` treated `tokenUsage` as higher-is-better; it is now lower-is-better like `latency` and `cost`. McNemar's test clamps the continuity correction at zero, so equal discordant counts give chi-square 0 and p-value 1.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 6a9453d: LLM-judge metrics, statistical metrics and file reporters report real numbers.

  - The judge configured on `EvalSuite`, `EvalBuilder` or `EvalComparison` was wired to a stub that echoed its own prompt, so judge metrics scored 0 (or whatever number the prompt contained). The judge now runs as a Cogitator agent on `judge.model` with a `{ score, reasoning }` JSON schema, through `judge.cogitator` or the `cogitator` of an agent target. **Breaking:** a suite with LLM metrics and nothing to run the judge now fails when it is built instead of scoring 0.
  - `latency()`, `cost()` and `tokenUsage()` reported a score of 0, so `aggregated.latency.p95` and `threshold('latency.p95', …)` were always 0 and always passed. They now return one value per case, the aggregate covers those values, and `aggregated.<name>.metadata` holds totals.
  - `report(['json', 'csv'], { path })` treats `path` as a base and writes `.json` and `.csv` files next to each other instead of overwriting one file, creates missing directories, and runs `ci` last.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- **Breaking:** requires Node.js 22.12 or newer (Node 20 reached end of life).

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @cogitator-ai/core@0.21.0

## 0.1.13

### Patch Changes

- Internal peer dependencies are now declared as version ranges instead of exact pins, so the package keeps installing cleanly alongside newer 0.x releases of @cogitator-ai/core.
- EvalSuite no longer swallows case failures silently: a case whose attempts all fail or time out now carries an `error` message on its result, timeouts are retried like other failures, and the per-attempt timeout timer is cleared.

### Patch Changes

- fix(evals): audit — 7 bugs fixed, +5 tests
  - csv-loader: replaced blocking `readFileSync` with async `readFile`
  - eval-suite: retry fallback now returns real elapsed duration instead of 0
  - eval-builder: removed duplicate `isLLMMetric` function (now imported from eval-suite)
  - regression: fixed `isLowerBetter` to include `*Duration` and `*Latency` suffix checks
  - regression: `noRegression` now fails when no baseline metrics found in current results (was incorrectly passing)
  - custom: assertion `check()` errors are now caught and returned as `passed: false`
  - statistical: converted index loop to for-of in tokenUsage

  Also removed unused dependencies `@cogitator-ai/types` and `nanoid`.
  Exported `isLLMMetric` as part of public API.
