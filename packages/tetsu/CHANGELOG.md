# @cogitator-ai/tetsu

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7bee3ef: Reasoning models and prompt caching work the same way on every provider.

  - **Reasoning.** `reasoning: { effort, budgetTokens?, summary? }` on an agent, a run or a `ChatRequest` (`effort` from `none` to `max`). Anthropic and Bedrock get adaptive thinking with the closest effort the Claude model accepts (`disabled` / `between_tools` / lowest effort for `none`, a thinking budget on Claude 3.7 – 4.5); OpenAI gets `reasoning.effort` and summaries; OpenAI-compatible servers `reasoning_effort`; Gemini `thinkingLevel` (3+) or `thinkingBudget` (2.5) with `includeThoughts`; Ollama `think`. The summary comes back as `ChatResponse.reasoning` / `delta.reasoning`, `RunResult.reasoning` and `onReasoning`; server adapters, Next.js handlers and hooks, and the AI SDK adapter stream it as `reasoning-start` / `reasoning-delta` / `reasoning-end` parts.
  - **Thinking across tool calls.** Claude thinking blocks (Anthropic and Bedrock) are kept with the tool calls they preceded and sent back during the tool loop — only after the latest user message, since they are bound to the conversation that produced them — and a request whose replayed blocks the API refuses is retried once without them.
  - **Prompt caching.** Agent runs cache by default (`llm.promptCache`, `false` turns it off): Anthropic requests carry `cache_control`, Bedrock requests cache points; every backend reports `usage.cachedInputTokens` / `cacheWriteTokens` / `reasoningTokens`. `@cogitator-ai/models` prices cache reads and writes (`inputCached`, new `inputCacheWrite`, `calculateCost()`), so run costs account for them.

  **Fixes:** Anthropic and Bedrock `inputTokens` now include cache reads and writes (they counted only uncached input); Gemini `outputTokens` now include thinking tokens (`thoughtsTokenCount`), which were billed but not counted.

- 7bee3ef: Runs pause for a person to approve sensitive tool calls and continue later.

  - A tool with `requiresApproval` never runs without a decision. `RunOptions.onApproval` (or `guardrails.onToolApproval`) decides inline; otherwise the run pauses before executing the turn and returns `status: 'paused'`, `pendingApprovals` and a JSON `checkpoint`. `cogitator.resume(agent, threadId | checkpoint, { decisions, defaultDecision, userId })` executes the approved calls, answers declined ones with the reason, and goes on. A new message on the thread instead declines the waiting calls.
  - Paused runs are kept per thread in the memory adapter's thread metadata (`ThreadRunCheckpointStore`), in process memory without memory (`InMemoryRunCheckpointStore`), or in `runCheckpoints`. Resuming by thread checks the caller (`THREAD_ACCESS_DENIED`); a thread with nothing paused answers the new `RUN_NOT_PAUSED` (409).
  - `agentAsTool` passes the caller's `userId` to the delegated run and declines its approvals unless given `onApproval`, instead of reporting a paused sub-run as success.
  - Server adapters answer paused runs with `status` / `pendingApprovals` (never the checkpoint), stream `approval-required`, and take `POST /agents/:name/resume` (plus a WebSocket `resume` message); Next.js has `createResumeHandler` and `pendingApprovals` / `approve()` / `deny()` in its hooks; channels ask in the chat and resume on "approve" / "deny <reason>" (also "да" / "нет").

  **Behaviour change:** `requiresApproval` used to be enforced only with constitutional guardrails and an `onToolApproval` callback; without them such tools ran unasked. They now pause the run. WebSocket `complete` events no longer include a paused run's checkpoint.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ed996c4: One agent can serve many users without them seeing each other's conversations or memory.

  - **Threads have owners.** The run that creates a thread records its `userId` (`thread.metadata.userId`). A run that passes a `threadId` continues it only for its owner and otherwise fails with the new `THREAD_ACCESS_DENIED` (403) before any history is loaded; a thread that cannot be read fails with `MEMORY_READ_FAILED` instead of being recreated without its owner. `RunOptions.threadAccess: 'shared'` opts out for threads your server derives itself (channels uses it, so group chats keep working). `assertThreadAccess`, `ensureThreadAccess`, `threadOwner` and `threadMetadata` are exported for your own endpoints.
  - **Memory is scoped by user.** `ContextBuilder.build({ userId })` leaves out facts, embeddings and knowledge graph nodes whose `metadata.userId` belongs to someone else; memory without an owner stays shared. The vector search filters in the adapter (`filter.userId` on the in-memory, Postgres and Qdrant adapters), so other users' memories cannot crowd out the user's own. Agent runs build the context for their `userId`, and the runtime now hands the context builder the memory adapter's facts and embeddings and the `memory.embedding` service, so `includeFacts`, `includeSemanticContext` and the `relevant`/`hybrid` strategies work in runs.
  - **Swarms and worker jobs** carry `userId` (`SwarmRunOptions.userId`, `addAgentJob(..., { userId })`) to every agent run.
  - **Server adapters** scope `/threads/:id` (read, append, clear) to the authenticated user and pass it to agent, stream, WebSocket and swarm runs. hono and koa now pass `auth`'s `userId` to runs at all (HTTP and WebSocket); next answers a run's `CogitatorError` with its status and `code` instead of 500, and chat streams cancel the run on client disconnect even after the Request object is no longer referenced. The shared OpenAPI spec lists the 403 of `/threads/:id` and agent runs.

  **Behaviour change:** threads created before, or by runs without a `userId`, have no owner and are open only to callers without one. Hand such a thread to a user by setting `metadata.userId` with `updateThread`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fca176: New package: the Cogitator HTTP API as a [Tetsu](https://tetsujs.com) controller for Bun. `cogitatorController()` serves agents, memory threads, workflows and swarms with Zod-validated requests and responses, SSE streams through `@tetsujs/sse`, an optional WebSocket endpoint, errors in Tetsu's `{ status, message, error }` envelope with `CogitatorError` codes mapped to their HTTP status, an `auth` hook that can be documented with `secured()` from `@tetsujs/openapi`, per-user thread access through `authorizeThread`, and `until` to end streams and sockets when the server drains.
