Threads are trees of typed entries, runs and forks go on branches of them, and derived memory can point at what it stands on.

- Every entry has a `parentId` (`null` at the root), a `seq` within its thread and a `type`, and a thread has an `activeLeafId`. `addEntry` goes on after the active leaf and moves it there in one step, takes an explicit `parentId` to write on another branch, and `activate: false` to leave the leaf where it is. Deleting an entry splices it out: its children follow its parent.
- Entry types: `message`, `tool_result`, and the events `model_change`, `compaction`, `approval`, `interrupt`, `label` and `custom`, which carry an `event` payload. `getEntries` and `getPath` return only `message` and `tool_result` unless `types` asks for more (or `'all'`), so readers that know nothing of events keep seeing the conversation.
- `getPath({ threadId, leafId?, limit?, before?, types? })` reads one branch from the root to its leaf, the newest `limit` entries and pages before an entry, without reading the whole thread. `rewind(threadId, toEntryId)` moves the leaf back along its branch and deletes nothing, `checkout(threadId, entryId)` makes any branch active, and `forkThread(threadId, atEntryId, newThreadId?)` copies a branch into a new thread (`metadata.forkOf` on the copies, `metadata.forkedFrom` on the thread). Every built-in adapter implements them, adapters of your own get them from `BranchingMemoryAdapter`.
- Entries written before this version are chained by time when first met: Postgres moves its schema to version 2 on `connect()`, SQLite migrates by `user_version`, Redis and MongoDB chain a thread the first time it is read or written. Upgrade every process that shares a store together, as an older process appends without a parent.
- `ContextBuilder` and the runtime read the active branch instead of the whole thread.
- Breaking: Redis keeps memory with no expiry by default (`ttl: 0`), where it used to expire after 24 hours. Pass `ttl` to keep the old behaviour. The in-process `memory` adapter counts `maxEntries` per thread, not across all threads, and evicts entries of inactive branches first.
- Runs on branches: `RunOptions.branch: { fromEntryId, activate? }` reads history along the branch that ends at `fromEntryId` (`null` for none) and chains the run's entries after it, and `RunResult.memory` says where the run wrote (`threadId`, `branchPoint`, `leafId`). The runtime records `model_change` when it falls back to another model, `approval` when a run pauses and `interrupt` when one is aborted, and a paused run resumes on its branch.
- Time travel: checkpoints keep where their run wrote, and live replays and forks go on a branch of the original thread from where the run started, without moving its active leaf. Forks of one run no longer share a `replay_<runId>` thread and see each other's entries. A replay goes on a thread of its own when the checkpoint has no place in memory, its branch point is gone or the conversation before the run was edited.
- Lineage: `Evidence { entryId?, toolCallId?, fileRange?, quote }` and an optional `evidence` on facts, graph nodes and edges and insights. `verifyEvidence` checks that a quote appears in its entry or tool result word for word, `verifyEvidenceInMemory` checks a list against stored entries, and `evidenceOnPath` keeps derived items whose evidence lies on a branch.
- Studio: a Tree panel next to the chat (`T`) shows every branch of a thread in memory, with forks, events and the run that wrote each entry.
- `@cogitator-ai/test-utils`: conformance cases for trees, branches, paths, rewind and checkout, forks, entry types and splicing deletes.
