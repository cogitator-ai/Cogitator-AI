'create-cogitator-app': patch

Generated scripts exit with code 1 when the run fails, so CI no longer reports a failed run as a success, and `workflow` also fails on an error in the workflow result. `memory` and `swarm` close their connections on failure too. The `workflow` template prints the report and each node's output instead of `nodeResults: {}`. The generated ignore file now covers every `.env.*` except `.env.example`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, and for `nextjs` the `.next/`, `out/` and `next-env.d.ts` build output.
