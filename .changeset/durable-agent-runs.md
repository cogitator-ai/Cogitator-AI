Durable agent runs that a crash or a deploy does not lose, queue jobs that go on from their last step, and streams a client resumes with `Last-Event-ID` in every server adapter.

Everything is off by default: without `durable` a run keeps no checkpoint while it goes on, without `resumableStreams` an adapter streams and aborts a run on disconnect as before. No breaking changes. `ErrorCode` has new members (`RUN_LEASED`, `RUN_NOT_FOUND`, `RUN_SUSPENDED`), so a `switch` over every code with no `default` needs cases for them.

Durable runs (core, types, config):

- `CogitatorConfig.durable: true | { enabled?, store?, leaseMs?, owner? }`, `AgentConfig.durable` and `RunOptions.durable` (the run's wins, then the agent's). A durable run keeps a `RunCheckpoint` with `status: 'running'` after every model turn and every batch of tool calls: counters, usage and cost, the turn going on, permission mode and rules, budgets, hook and stop hook state, project instructions, the command, the messages queued on its handle, answered interrupts and delegated children. Each step writes what is new: the conversation's start once (`DurableRunRecord.base`), messages the thread's log holds as references to their entries (`RunCheckpoint.compact`), and between steps only small journal marks (`DurableRunMark`: a tool call started, returned, the queue changed). A run started from a tool call of another run is never durable on its own, its caller is.
- `cog.recoverRuns({ agents, resume?, filter?, options? })` continues the runs a stopped process left running and returns a `RunHandle` for each (`RecoveredAgentRuns`: `resumed`, `skipped`, and `found` with `resume: false`). The conversation comes back from the checkpoint and the log, entries written after the last checkpoint are taken in (a logged model turn is not asked for again, a logged final answer ends the run), a tool call that returned keeps its result and never runs twice, one that was running gets `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN`, one that never started after a lost call gets `ABORTED_BEFORE_DISPATCH`, and queued messages are delivered. `cog.recoverRun(agent, runId, options)`, `cog.discardRun(runId)` (answers the open calls and forgets the run) and `cog.durableRuns(filter)` (with `held`) act on single runs.
- Leases: a process holds each durable run it runs (`acquire`, `renew` at every step and a third of the way through `leaseMs`, default 60 000), so two processes never continue one run. A process that lost its lease stops the run with `RUN_LEASED` before its next tool or write. A run aborted with a `CogitatorError` of code `RUN_SUSPENDED` keeps its checkpoint and lets its lease go, for another process to take at once. `owner` names the holder, a stable one lets a restarted process recover its runs without waiting for their leases.
- Stores implement `DurableRunStore`: `InMemoryDurableRunStore` (the default without memory), `ThreadDurableRunStore` (the default with a memory adapter, in the run's thread metadata, one process at a time since a memory adapter cannot lock) and `RedisDurableRunStore` (atomic leases in Lua scripts, any number of processes, `@cogitator-ai/redis` clients and ioredis).
- `RunOptions.runId` names a run (`RUN_LEASED` when a durable run with that id is kept). Entries of durable runs carry `metadata.durableRun`. The config package reads `durable` (`DurableRunsConfigSchema`).

Workers:

- `WorkerConfig.durable` runs agent jobs as durable runs named after the job (`job:<jobId>`, `durableJobRunId()`): the attempt after a crash or a shutdown, on any worker, recovers the run and goes on from its last step instead of running the job again. The pool's own Cogitator keeps the runs in its Redis, a Cogitator you pass needs a shared store. On `stop()` and `forceStop()` the pool aborts durable runs with `RUN_SUSPENDED`, so they hand over at once. `processAgentJob(payload, runtime, { durable: true })` for processors called directly.

Resumable streams (server-shared, express, fastify, hono, koa, tetsu, next):

- Every adapter takes `resumableStreams?: boolean | { store?, maxEvents?, retentionMs?, maxStreams?, detachedTimeoutMs? }`. With it on, every SSE event of `/agents/:name/stream` and `/agents/:name/resume/stream` carries an `id` (`<streamId>:<seq>`), a client that disconnects no longer stops the run, and the same route with `Last-Event-ID` (or `?lastEventId=`) replays what the client missed and follows the run to its end. Only the user who started a stream may reconnect (`404 STREAM_NOT_FOUND` otherwise, also for an unknown or expired stream), a reconnect behind the kept events gets an `error` event `STREAM_RESUME_GAP` telling the client to fetch the thread, and a run nobody follows for `detachedTimeoutMs` (5 minutes) is stopped and ends with `STREAM_ABORTED`. Events live in a pluggable `StreamReplayStore` (`InMemoryStreamReplayStore` by default, bounded by `maxEvents`, `retentionMs` and `maxStreams`), a shared store with pub/sub lets a reconnect land on any process.
- server-shared: `ResumableStreams`, `StreamReplayStore`, `InMemoryStreamReplayStore`, event id helpers (`formatStreamEventId`, `parseStreamEventId`, `lastEventIdOf`), `encodeSSE(data, id?)`, OpenAPI docs of `Last-Event-ID` (`SwaggerConfig.resumableStreams`), and conformance cases for resumable streams with a reconnect step (`ConformanceCase.reconnect`, `conformanceReconnectRequest`, `parseSseFrames`). Stream writers of every adapter take an optional event id in `send(event, id?)`.
- next: `createChatHandler` and `createResumeHandler({ stream: true })` take `resumableStreams` (a reconnect resends the request body, `beforeRun` identifies the caller). `useCogitatorChat` reconnects a stream that drops mid-run with `Last-Event-ID` and continues the message in place (`reconnect: { attempts, delayMs }`, on by default, only effective when the server sends ids, `false` turns it off), and its SSE parser reads `id:` lines per the SSE spec.
- WebSocket transports keep their own frame protocol and are not resumable: use SSE for runs a client must be able to rejoin.
