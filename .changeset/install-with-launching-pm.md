The install runs with the package manager that launched the scaffolder, from the `npm_execpath` it sets, and falls back to the one on PATH. A pnpm started by its full path or as a standalone binary, which is not on PATH, failed the install with "pnpm is not installed". `cogitator add` installs the same way.
