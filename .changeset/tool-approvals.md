Runs pause for a person to approve sensitive tool calls and continue later.

- A tool with `requiresApproval` never runs without a decision. `RunOptions.onApproval` (or `guardrails.onToolApproval`) decides inline; otherwise the run pauses before executing the turn and returns `status: 'paused'`, `pendingApprovals` and a JSON `checkpoint`. `cogitator.resume(agent, threadId | checkpoint, { decisions, defaultDecision, userId })` executes the approved calls, answers declined ones with the reason, and goes on. A new message on the thread instead declines the waiting calls.
- Paused runs are kept per thread in the memory adapter's thread metadata (`ThreadRunCheckpointStore`), in process memory without memory (`InMemoryRunCheckpointStore`), or in `runCheckpoints`. Resuming by thread checks the caller (`THREAD_ACCESS_DENIED`); a thread with nothing paused answers the new `RUN_NOT_PAUSED` (409).
- `agentAsTool` passes the caller's `userId` to the delegated run and declines its approvals unless given `onApproval`, instead of reporting a paused sub-run as success.
- Server adapters answer paused runs with `status` / `pendingApprovals` (never the checkpoint), stream `approval-required`, and take `POST /agents/:name/resume` (plus a WebSocket `resume` message); Next.js has `createResumeHandler` and `pendingApprovals` / `approve()` / `deny()` in its hooks; channels ask in the chat and resume on "approve" / "deny <reason>" (also "да" / "нет").

**Behaviour change:** `requiresApproval` used to be enforced only with constitutional guardrails and an `onToolApproval` callback; without them such tools ran unasked. They now pause the run. WebSocket `complete` events no longer include a paused run's checkpoint.
