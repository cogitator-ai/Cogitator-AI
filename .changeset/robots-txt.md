Agents can crawl politely. Nothing in Cogitator looked at robots.txt, so every app that read the web had to write its own check. `RobotsPolicy` in core reads and caches robots.txt per site by RFC 9309 (product token groups or `*`, longest match, `*` and `$` patterns, a 4xx file allows all, a 5xx or a network failure allows nothing until the cache expires) and implements the new `RobotsChecker` interface from types. `WebLoader` takes it as `robots` and checks every hop, redirect targets included, failing with `RobotsDisallowedError` before any request. `BrowserSession` takes it as `robots` and blocks disallowed navigations, typed, clicked, redirected or in frames, while `newTab(url)` and `browser_navigate` say why.
