Agents can run on backends of your own. `llm.backends` takes `LLMBackend` instances by name: an agent with model `name/model` or `provider: 'name'` runs on it, and a name of a built-in provider replaces it. Backend plugins registered with `registerLLMBackend()` are now used by the runtime, created on first use with their config from `llm.plugins`; before, the registry was never consulted. A provider nobody provides fails with `CONFIGURATION_ERROR`. `cogitator.route(model)` returns the backend and model name a run uses. With `fromAISDK()`, any AI SDK model now runs Cogitator agents, tools included.
