`PostgresAdapter` checks the vector size of an existing `embeddings` table on `connect()`. An adapter without a configured size adopts it, and one configured for another size (after switching the embedding model) reports the mismatch through `vectorStatus()` and a clear failure from `addEmbedding` and `search` instead of a Postgres error on each search. The size can now be set with `dimensions` in `PostgresAdapterConfig` and `memory.postgres.dimensions`, as well as `setVectorDimensions()`.
