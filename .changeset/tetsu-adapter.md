'@cogitator-ai/tetsu': minor
---

New package: the Cogitator HTTP API as a [Tetsu](https://tetsujs.com) controller for Bun. `cogitatorController()` serves agents, memory threads, workflows and swarms with Zod-validated requests and responses, SSE streams through `@tetsujs/sse`, an optional WebSocket endpoint, errors in Tetsu's `{ status, message, error }` envelope with `CogitatorError` codes mapped to their HTTP status, an `auth` hook that can be documented with `secured()` from `@tetsujs/openapi`, per-user thread access through `authorizeThread`, and `until` to end streams and sockets when the server drains.
