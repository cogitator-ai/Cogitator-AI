The run callbacks `onApprovalRequired`, `onTimerScheduled`, `onDeadLetter`, `onCompensationStart` and `onCompensationComplete` are now called by the executor and the manager. Nodes can declare a saga rollback with `config.compensation`: when a later node fails, the executor compensates the completed nodes (reverse order by default) before returning the error.
