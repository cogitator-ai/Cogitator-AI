`RunOptions.toolChoice` sets which tools the model may or must call in a run. `'none'` holds for every turn. `'required'` or a named function forces a call on each turn until the model makes one, then the run goes back to `'auto'`, so the model answers from the results instead of calling tools until `maxIterations`. A named function the agent does not have fails the run with `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

The OpenAI-compatible endpoints pass `tool_choice: 'required'` and a named function on to the run, where before they only narrowed the tools and a model could still answer in plain text. The AI SDK bridge forces `required` and a named tool of the agent the same way instead of warning that it cannot.
